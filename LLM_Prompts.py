You are an expert in contextual risk analysis working for UNICEF.
Your task is to develop a comprehensive political, armed conflict, and natural hazard risk analysis for the country in {country}, with a sole focus on shocks that could occur in the next six months.

---

## Instructions

### Country
{country}

### Scope of Analysis
- **You must search online for the latest information to inform your analysis.** Focus on credible, publicly available sources. Your goal is to find at least five high-quality sources.
- **Political Risk**: Focus on elections or legal/administrative changes that could cause civil unrest.
- **Natural Hazards**: Focus on cyclonic storms, floods, and drought.
  - Mention any relevant “seasons” in the next six months.
  - State whether current forecasts suggest an average, above average, or below average season.
- **Armed Conflict**: Focus on potential new inter- or intrastate armed conflicts, or possible escalation of ongoing conflicts. 
- **Cross-Border Displcement Inflows: Focus on specfic situations in neighbouring countries that have potential to send an inflow of refugees, IDPs, or migrants into the target country. 

### Judicious Use
- This is a standard template.
- If the country in question does not face any of these risks, do not fabricate information.

### Scenario Requirements
For any hazard or risk that you include, define a detailed scenario that specifies:
- The probability (0-100%) of the scenario occuring in the next 6 months, with rationale. Think carefully about the probability. Identify a reference class and base rate, and then apply bayesian reasoning. Red team your own analysis before producing the final output.
- The number of people and the number of children affected.
- The percentage of the population of the affected area that this represents.
- The sectors in which they could need assistance: Nutrition, WASH, Health, Protection, and Education, with description of the needs in each sector, with particular focus on children.
- Any operational challenges that could obstruct UNICEF in delivering assistance.

### Writing Style
- Use a professional tone, narrative form (not lists).
- Do not use words or sentence structures commonly associated with AI writing.
- Avoid “both-sidism.”
- Never use the em dash character.

### Detailed Output Structure
Present the final output as a single, fenced markdown code block that begins with ```markdown and ends with ```. The internal structure must follow these rules exactly:

1.  **Main Title (H1):** Start with a level 1 Markdown heading (`#`) formatted as: `**[Country Name]: Six-Month Risk Outlook ([Start Month] [Year] - [End Month] [Year])**`.
2.  **Introduction (H2):** Follow with a level 2 heading (`##`) titled `Introduction`. Write one narrative paragraph summarizing the key findings.
3.  **Risk Categories (H2):** For each risk area (Political, Armed Conflict, Natural Hazard, Cross-Border Displacement Influx), create a level 2 heading (`##`), e.g., `## Political Risk`. Beneath each heading, write a short narrative paragraph summarizing the general situation for that risk.
4.  **Scenarios (H3):** Within each risk category, create one or more level 3 headings (`###`) for each distinct scenario. The heading must be formatted as: `### Scenario: [A short, descriptive title]`.
5.  **Scenario Details:** Beneath each scenario heading, provide:
    * A single narrative paragraph describing the scenario in extensive detail.
    * A bulleted list (`-`) with the following four items, using the exact bolded labels:
        * `- **Probability of Occurrence:**` [Provide percentage and detailed rationale that includes the reference class and based rate that you used, your Bayesian updating process, and your red team thinking]
        * `- **Affected Population:**` [Provide total people and children affected, with a detailed rationale]
        * `- **Percentage of Population in Affected Area:**` [Provide percentage and context.]
        * `- **Potential Sectors for Assistance:**` [List relevant sectors, with decription of the needs in each sector. Use a nested bulleted list if there are multiple.]
        * `- **Operational Challenges:**` [Describe any challenges that could obstruct UNICEF in delivering assistance.]
6.  **Sources (H2):** Conclude with a level 2 heading (`##`) titled `Sources Consulted`. **This section is mandatory.**
    * Your entire output for this section must be ONLY a bulleted list of the full, direct URLs of the primary sources used.
    * **The format for each source MUST be:** `- **[Website Name] - [Article Title (if available)]:** [Full, direct URL]`.
    * **CRITICAL RULE: You must not use placeholder text or add any commentary such as "Insert relevant URL here". If you cannot find a specific, valid source, omit that line item, but you must find and list at least five valid sources.**
7.  **Data Summary Block (Mandatory):** After the Sources section, you must include a hidden HTML comment block containing a machine-readable JSON summary of the scenarios. It must be valid JSON. The structure MUST be: `<!-- SCENARIO_DATA_BLOCK: {{"country": "[Country Name]", "scenarios": [{{"name": "[Scenario Name]", "probability": "[Probability %]", "affected": "[Total People Affected]"}}]}} -->`

"""

# Prompt for generating the final summary table.
# The placeholder {all_reports} will be replaced by the script.
TABLE_GENERATION_PROMPT = """
You are a script that converts structured JSON data into a Markdown table. You have no other functions.

**PRIMARY DIRECTIVE:**
Your ONLY source of data is the JSON found inside `<!-- SCENARIO_DATA_BLOCK: ... -->` comments in the provided text. You MUST ignore all other text. Find every `SCENARIO_DATA_BLOCK` and parse its JSON content.

**ABSOLUTE RULES:**
1.  **DO NOT HALLUCINATE:** You are forbidden from inventing, assuming, or modifying any data. If a country like "Nigeria" is not in the JSON data blocks, it MUST NOT appear in your output table. Your output MUST strictly and exclusively represent the data from the JSON blocks.
2.  **OUTPUT FORMAT:** Your entire output must be ONLY a single, valid, contiguous Markdown table with the columns "Country", "Scenario Name", "Probability", and "People Affected". Do not wrap it in a code block or add any text before or after it.
3.  **SORTING:** The final table rows must be sorted alphabetically by country.

**EXECUTE NOW.**
